## About

I'm working on this project to develop my knowledge of full-stack app
development and, in particular, get comfortable with TDD. The main branch
includes only user CRUD operations, as this would provide me with a great
jumping off point for future projects.

I've tried to make it as **responsive**, **accessible** and **secure** as I can.
