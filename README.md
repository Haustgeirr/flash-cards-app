## About

I'm working on this project to develop my knowledge of full-stack app
development and, in particular, get comfortable with TDD. The main branch
includes only user CRUD operations so far. I started with the User to make all
authenticated routes easier to handle going forward and to give a great jumping
off point for future projects.

I've tried to make it as **responsive**, **accessible** and **secure** as I can.

### What I'm Working On

Right now I'm working on the Deck and Card routes in the dev branch. Once the
main CRUD operations are done I'll then work on the core app logic which will
primarily be a 'Test Me' feature. This will use a version of the
[Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) to test the user.
At this point the core functionality of the app will be complete.
